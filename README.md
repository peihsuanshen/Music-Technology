# Music-Technology

Explored of topics such as acoustics, psychoacoustics, digital sound, digital signal processing, audio synthesis, spectral analysis, algorithmic composition, music information retrieval, and relationships between art and science, theory and practice, and between experimental and popular electronic music. 

Learned about these topics in the context of digital audio workstation (DAW) software, the multi-track editing paradigm that has been dominant in music production since the 1980s. As we learn about the foundations behind such software, we will use this knowledge to more effectively create music with it, and we will also write a series of short software programs that extend the softwareâ€™s ability to manipulate, transform, and analyze sound.
